## About Me  

I’m an aspiring data analyst who loves diving into complex datasets to extract meaningful insights. After spending over 15 years as a professional journalist, including four years dedicated to fact-checking, I decided to embrace my passion for data analysis. I embarked on a full-time 12-week Data Analytics bootcamp, where I acquired the technical skills and hands-on experience necessary to achieve my dream of transitioning into a data analysis career. I’m excited to use this space to showcase my projects and experiences.
