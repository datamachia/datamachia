## About Me  

I am an aspiring data analyst who loves diving into complex datasets to extract meaningful insights. After spending over 15 years as a professional journalist, including four years dedicated to fact-checking, I decided to embrace my passion for data analysis, embarking on a full-time 12-week Data Analytics bootcamp, where I got the technical skills and hands-on experience needed to achieve my dream of transitioning into a data analysis career. I am excited to use this space to showcase some of my projects and share my experiences.
